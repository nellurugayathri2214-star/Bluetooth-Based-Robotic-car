# Bluetooth-Based-Robotic-car
This project control a robotic car movement using bluetooth commands. components: LPC2129, Motor driver(L293D), HC-05 bluetooth,DC Motors. commands-->forward-->Backward-->left->right-->stop, I-->increase the speed in forward. This project how embedded systems, wireless communication and motor control can be combined to create a low cost.
